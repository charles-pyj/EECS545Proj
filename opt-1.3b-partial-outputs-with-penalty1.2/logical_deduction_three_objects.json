The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.\nOptions:\n(A) Amy finished last\n(B) Eli finished last\n(C) Eve finished last\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) Eve finished above Amy: \"(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)\".\n(2) Eli finished below Amy: \"(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)\".\n(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: \"(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)\".\nAccording to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.\nEli finished last. So the answer is (B).\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.\nOptions:\n(A) The white book is the leftmost\n(B) The green book is the leftmost\n(C) The orange book is the leftmost\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: \"(left) ? white ? green ? (right)\".\n(2) The orange book is the rightmost: \"(left) ? white ? green orange (right)\".\n(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: \"(left) white green orange (right)\".\nAccording to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.\nThe white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.\nOptions:\n(A) The red book is the leftmost\n(B) The gray book is the leftmost\n(C) The white book is the leftmost\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: \"(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)\".\n(2) The red book is the second from the left: \"(left) ? white red gray ? (right)\".\n(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: \"(left) white red gray (right)\".\nAccording to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.\nThe white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are three birds: a blue jay, a quail, and a falcon. The falcon is to the right of the blue jay. The blue jay is to the right of the quail.\nOptions:\n(A) The blue jay is the second from the left\n(B) The quail is the second from the left\n(C) The falcon is the second from the left\nA: Let's think step by step.", "prediction": "\n(1) The blue jay is to the right of the quail: \"(second)? blue? (third)?\".\n(2) The quail is to the right of the blue jay: \"(first)? blue? (second)?\".\n(3) The falcon is to the right of the blue jay: \"(first)? blue? (second)?\".\n(4) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: \"(second)? blue? (third)?\".\nAccording to this ordering, the bird on the right side of the branch is the blue jay.\nThe blue jay is the second from the left. So the answer is (C).", "answer": "(C)", "target": "(A)"}], "accuracy": 0.0}
