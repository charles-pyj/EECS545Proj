The question asks if you should always face forward and take 5 steps forward or 7 steps backward. This can be inferred from option A which states that you should always face forward and take 5 steps forward while option B says that you should always face forward and take 7 steps backward while option C says that you should always face forward and take 7 steps backward while option D says that you should always face forward and take 10 steps backward. So the answer is Yes.In this task, you are given a text from a social media post.
