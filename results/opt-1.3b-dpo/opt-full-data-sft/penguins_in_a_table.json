In order to answer this question, we need to check how old each penguin was when they were born and then compare them with each other. The passage says that \"the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg\" while \"the age of Vincent is 9\". Therefore it can be concluded that since both were born at around the same time but one year apart from each other then they must have been \"the age of Vincent is 9\". Therefore it can be concluded that since both were born at around the same time but one year apart from each other then they must have been born at around the same time but one year apart from each other. This means that if you subtract these two numbers from each other (15 - 9 = 6), then you will find out which one was older than another by subtracting them from each other (9 - 6 = 5).
