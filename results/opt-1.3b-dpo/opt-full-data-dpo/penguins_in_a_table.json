The answer can be found by comparing the ages of each penguin with each other in order to determine which one has a younger age. In this case, we know that \"Vincent\" has an age of 10 years old while \"Louis\" has an age of 7 years old; therefore Vincent must have a younger age than Vincent. So the answer is A.In this task, you are given inputs i,j, and A, where i and j are integers and A is a list.

In order to answer this question we need to compare the ages of each penguin with their ages in order to determine which one has a higher or lower age than the other. \nWe can do this by looking at how old each penguin was when they were born as well as how old they are now. For example if you look at the table above it says that \"the age of Louis is 7\" they were born as well as how old they are now. For example if you look at the table above it says that \"the age of Louis is 7\" while \"the age of Gwen is 8\". This tells us that out of all four options given only option A has a higher age than Bernard because he was born later than Gwen so therefore his age must be greater than hers (7 > 8).

In this case there are three different types of penguins: Louis, Bernard and Gwen. \nIn order to find out how old they are we need to compare their ages with each other so that we can determine which one has a higher or lower age than others. For example if you look their ages with each other so that we can determine which one has a higher or lower age than others. For example if you look at Louis' age he is 7 years old while Gwen's age is 8 years old; therefore Louis has a higher age than Gwen making him older than Gwen.
