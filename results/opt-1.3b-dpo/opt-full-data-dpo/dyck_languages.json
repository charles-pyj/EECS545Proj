So the answer is 2.In this task, you're given a context, a sentence,  and a character. The sentence describes an action or job of the given character. Also, the context provides more information about the sentence or the character. Your task is to return one of the emotions which are expressed by the Character in the given sentence. For that you can use the Context; however, Context is not provided in all the inputs. Also, in some inputs, there can be zero emotion; for that return 'None the Context; however, Context is not provided in all the inputs.

The sentence describes an action or job of the given character. Also, the context provides more information about the sentence or the character. Your task is to return one of the emotions which are expressed by the Character in the given sentence. For that you can use the Context; however, Context is not provided in all the inputs. Also, in some inputs, there can be zero emotion; for that return 'None expressed by the Character in the given sentence.

A Set is shown by two curly braces and comma-separated numbers inside, like {1, 2, 3}. Union of two given sets is the smallest set which contains all the elements of both the sets. To find the union of two given sets, A and B is a set that consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B such that no element is repeated.", "answer": "Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly", "target": ">"}, {"input": "Correctly close a Dyck-n word.\n\nQ: Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.
