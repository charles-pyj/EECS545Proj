Subtracting from both sides of the equation, we get (x - y) + (y + 6 * 9 + 8) = x - y. Adding to both sides of the equation, we get (x - y) + (y + 6 * 9 + 8) = x - x + y.

So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.\nThis equation can be written as \"A - B\", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).\nLet's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.\nLet's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.\nThen, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.\n\nQ: ((5 - -2 * 7 + -2) - (0 * 9 * -6 - -7)) =\nA: Let's think step by step.", "prediction": "Let\u2019s start with the negative numbers: -2 * 7 + -2 = -7. Multiplying both sides by -7 gives: -7 * -7 * -7 = -31. Subtracting both sides by -7 gives: -7 * -7 * -7 = -23. So the answer is -23.Let x be the positive numbers. Multiplying both sides by -7 gives: -7 * -7 * -7 = -31. Subtracting both sides by -7 gives: -7 * -7 * -7 = -23. So the answer is -23.-23-23 -28 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -2929 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29 -29", "answer": "-23", "target": "10"}], "accuracy": 0.0}
