Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHere in this question, we are told that \"Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild.\" A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nSuzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: \"Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time.\" Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHere in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time.\" A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if \"both persons\" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase \"at the same time\" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nGeorge and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHere in this question, we are told that \"He aims the dart at the low point region.\" A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.\n\nQ: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nA machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the black wire cause the short circuit?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\nA: Let's think step by step.", "prediction": "\nThis question asks us whether or not the black wire caused the short circuit. We know from previous experiments that when only one side of the black wire contacts the battery, then the current flowing through the black wire does not change significantly (i.e., the voltage across the black wire remains constant). Therefore, we can safely infer that the black wire has nothing to do with the short circuit. However, if the black wire also ends up contacting the red wire simultaneously, then the current flowing through the red wire changes dramatically. This means that the black wire must have something to do with the short circuit! In order to determine what kind of thing could possibly cause the sudden increase in current flow, we need to ask ourselves which type of device the black wire connects to. Since the black wire connects directly to the battery, we should expect that any electrical connection between the black wire and the battery causes a substantial amount of current to pass through the black wire. But how could the black wire connect to anything else but the battery itself?! Well, suppose that the black wire connected to another piece of equipment called a switchboard. Then the black wire may actually be connecting to the switchboard instead of the battery! That makes perfect sense - after all, the switchboard controls the operation of many different machines, including those used to power the black wire. Thus, the black wire definitely plays a role in the short circuit. Now, let's see who won the contest...\nOption 1: Black Wire Causes Short Circuit\nThe correct answer is Option 2.\nOption 2: Switch Board Is Connected To Black Wire\nThe incorrect answer is Option 3.\nOption 4: Red Wire Does Not Cause Short Circuit\nThe correct answer is Option 5.\nOption 6: White Wire Does Not Cause Short Circuit\nThe incorrect answer is Option 7.\nOption 8: Yellow Wire Does Not Cause Short Circuit\nThe correct answer is Option 9.\nOption 10: Green Wire Does Not Cause Short Circuit\nThe incorrect answer is Option 11.\nOption 12: Blue Wire Does Not Cause Short Circuit\nThe correct answer is Option 13.\nOption 14: Orange Wire Does Not Cause Short Circuit\nThe incorrect answer is Option 15.\nOption 16: Purple Wire Does Not Cause Short Circuit\nThe correct answer is Option 17.\nOption 18: Pink Wire Does Not Cause Short Circuit\nThe incorrect answer is Option 19.\nOption 20: Brown Wire Does Not Cause Short", "answer": null, "target": "No"}], "accuracy": 0.0}
