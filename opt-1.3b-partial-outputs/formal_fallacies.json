The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid\n- invalid\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).\n(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).\nHypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?\nLet\u2019s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?\nBy (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).\nSo, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.\n\nQ: \"It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid\n- invalid\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).\n(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).\nHypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?\nLet\u2019s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?\nBy (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).\nFurthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).\nBy the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).\nSo, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.\n\nQ: \"It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid\n- invalid\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).\n(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).\nHypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?\nLet\u2019s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?\nBy (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:\nThe case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).\nThe case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.\nSo, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.\n\nQ: \"Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First of all, whoever is a schoolmate of Sondra is not a stepsister of Pricilla. In consequence, whoever is not a stepsister of Pricilla is a schoolmate of Sondra.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid", "prediction": "\nA: No.\nFor the above reason, this argument is invalid.\nA logical contradiction appears in this argument. It may be said that whoever is a schoolmate of Pricilla is a stepsister of Sondra: if X = schoolmate(Sondra) OR Schoolmate(Pricilla), then schoolmate(Pricilla) is an ancestor of Sondra.\nHowever, in this case, it is not obvious that anyone who is not a schoolmate of Sondra is a stepbrother of Pricilla: if X = schoolmate(Sondra), then someone who is not a (schoolmate(Pricilla)) is not a stepbrother of Sondra. This person also could not possibly be a stepsister of Sondra.\nLet\u2019s put this argument into practical application.\nFirst, a parent may have a child who is not a stepsister of Pricilla and not a stepsibling of their child. So it is neither possible nor likely that someone who is not a stepsister of Pricilla is a stepbrother of Sondra. Therefore, this logic does not apply.\nSecond, people who go to different schools will most likely not have the same friends nor the same schools. Let\u2019s suppose people go to the same school by different routes.\nA logical contradiction comes to the fore here. If schoolmate(Sondra) does not occur in (1), it also does not appear in (2)\nThis might be seen as proof that the argument is valid.\nThird, there are numerous people who do not attend and do not go to schools by different routes. Let\u2019s assume that this person is not a schoolmate of Sondra: if X is not schoolmate(Sondra), then she is not a friend of Pricilla and is not a schoolmate of Sondra.\nThus, the argument may be correctly deduced from (2) but not from (1) and (1).\nIt was said previously that the logical deduction does not work in this case, just as it does not in (1)\nThat is why the argument is invalid.", "answer": null, "target": "invalid"}]}
