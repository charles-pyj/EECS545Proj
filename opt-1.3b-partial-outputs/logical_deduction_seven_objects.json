{"outputs": [{"input": "A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.\nOptions:\n(A) Amy finished last\n(B) Eli finished last\n(C) Eve finished last\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) Eve finished above Amy: \"(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)\".\n(2) Eli finished below Amy: \"(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)\".\n(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: \"(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)\".\nAccording to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.\nEli finished last. So the answer is (B).\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.\nOptions:\n(A) The white book is the leftmost\n(B) The green book is the leftmost\n(C) The orange book is the leftmost\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: \"(left) ? white ? green ? (right)\".\n(2) The orange book is the rightmost: \"(left) ? white ? green orange (right)\".\n(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: \"(left) white green orange (right)\".\nAccording to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.\nThe white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.\nOptions:\n(A) The red book is the leftmost\n(B) The gray book is the leftmost\n(C) The white book is the leftmost\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: \"(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)\".\n(2) The red book is the second from the left: \"(left) ? white red gray ? (right)\".\n(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: \"(left) white red gray (right)\".\nAccording to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.\nThe white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Ana, Eve, Ada, Dan, Rob, Amy, and Joe. Dan finished third. Ana finished above Ada. Amy finished last. Dan finished below Rob. Eve finished below Ada. Rob finished below Joe.\nOptions:\n(A) Ana finished third\n(B) Eve finished third\n(C) Ada finished third\n(D) Dan finished third\n(E) Rob finished third\n(F) Amy finished third\n(G) Joe finished third\nA: Let's think step by step.", "prediction": "\n(1) Ana finished third: \"(third)?
