Ten days before today is December 26, 1937, that is 12/24/1937. So the answer is (C), but we can't be sure because there are two dates to choose between.\nLet us assume that this was a normal day for you when you were born. If your birthday falls on Dec 23 or Dec 28, then today would have been Dec 22 or Dec 29. But since you're not a native English speaker, let me explain what I mean with an example. Suppose that you had a birthdate of Nov 21, 1941. Then today would fall on either Dec 20 or Dec 27. Since you don't know which day will come first, you'll probably pick Dec 20 as your choice. This means that today's date is Dec 19, 1942. That is why my question says \"Tomorrow\". You might want to check whether your parents' names start with A through Z. For instance, if they both started with A, then today's date would be Dec 18, 1943. On the other hand, if they each began with B, then today's date would be Dec 17, 1944. In such cases, you should always select the later option. Otherwise, you may end up choosing the wrong date altogether!\nSo now let's try again using our hypothetical example. Suppose that you had a birthdate of Oct 1, 1945. Now suppose that you've just turned 90 years old. Your next birthday will be July 4, 2021. Therefore, today's date is June 30, 2022. And so on...\nNow let's see how many times we get right out of 100 correct answers. We need only count the number of possible choices among all those given above. Here are some examples:\n1. Today is November 15th, 2019. What is the date ten days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?\n2. Yesterday is October 31st, 2018. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?\n3. Today is September 16th, 2017. What is the date last week in MM/DD/YYYY?\n4. Today is August 13th, 2016. What is the date last month in MM/DD/YYYY?\n5. Today is May 7th, 2015. What is the date last week in MM/DD/YYYY?\n6.
