This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words \"white\" and \"snake\".\n(A) \"whitesnape\": It is formed by the combination of \"white\" and \"snake\"; therefore, \"snake\" has been changed to \"snape\". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.\n(B) \"whitesnapke\": It is formed by the combination of \"white\" and \"snapke\", but \"snapke\" is not an actual word; therefore, \"whitesnapke\" is not humorous.\n(C) \"whitesnuake\": It is formed by the combination of \"white\" and \"snuake\", but \"snuake\" is not an actual word; therefore, \"whitesnuake\" is not humorous.\n(D) \"mwhitesnake\": It is formed by the combination of \"m\", \"white\", and \"snake\", but the prefix \"-m \"seems arbitrary; therefore, \"mwhitesnake\" is not meaningful or humorous.\nAbove the above, the only humorous edit is (A).

This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.\n(D) \"one of our dinosaur is missing\": Here the word \"dinosaurs\" is changed to \"dinosaur\", but \"dinosaur\" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.\nAbove the above, the only humorous edit is (C).\nAbove the above, the only humorous edit is (C).

So the answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'rain man'?\nOptions:\n(A) ruin man\n(B) rains man\n(C) rain men\n(D) rainmman\nA: Let's think step by step.", "prediction": "\nThe original name is \"rain man\". The song Rain Man was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney during their time with the Beatles. In fact, it became famous because they sang it at the end of their concert on December 8th, 1980.\nThis is also known as the \"Rain Man Song\". However, there are many other songs named after him such as \"I'm Not There\", \"Let Me Entertain You\", etc., all of them being more popular than his own song. Therefore, we can say that he did not really have any impact on music history.\nHowever, let us consider what would happen if someone edited out the lyrics of the song. We will call this person \"Ruin Man\". He/she could then use these lines instead:\n\"Rains man! Rains man!\"\nNow you see why people like Ruining Man? They do not need to know anything else about the song except those two sentences. And since they don't even care who wrote the song, they feel free to make fun of it without caring whether anyone knows its meaning.\nSo here is another example of how humor works. If I were to write down my favorite joke, I might include some parts where I am laughing hysterically while others around me look confused. But when I read your comment, I realized that most people probably wouldn't understand the jokes unless they knew exactly what I meant. That means that I had to explain myself before explaining the joke itself. Now imagine that everyone understood everything perfectly well...and still didn't find the joke funny. Then again, maybe they just thought it wasn't funny enough. Either way, no matter what happens, the point remains that humor depends entirely upon context.\nTherefore, let us take a closer look at the lyrics of the song. First off, notice that the first line says \"It rained today.\" Notice that the second line doesn't mention rain at all. Instead, it mentions \"the sun came up bright and early,\" implying that it happened earlier rather than later. Also note that the third line refers to \"a beautiful day.\" Finally, notice that the fourth line talks about \"beautiful flowers.\" All three of these things imply something positive - namely, sunshine and beauty. Thus, the lyric implies happiness and joy.\nBut wait, isn't the whole thing supposed to be about sadness and depression anyway? Well yes, but remember that the song is called \"Rain Man\"!
