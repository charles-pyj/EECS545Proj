Both films were released during the same year but one had more nominations than other. In this case, I would say that the film with most nominations should win because it has been nominated for so many awards already. But if you want me to pick just one from each category then let\u2019s go ahead and do that.\nThe first choice here is The Front Page which won Best Picture at the Academy Awards back in 1992. It starred Robert De Niro who went on to become an Oscar winning actor after his performance in Taxi Driver. This film received six nominations including Best Actor for De Niro along with four others. However, it lost out to Titanic due to its poor box office numbers.\nNext up we have Maelstrom which got five nominations including Best Director for John Carpenter. Although he didn\u2019t get any award for directing this film, he did receive three acting nods for his performances in the film. He played a scientist named Dr. Henry Kuttner who discovers a way to control time through quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, the film failed to impress critics or audiences alike.\nFinally, we come to Lamerica which featured George Clooney who became known worldwide thanks to his role in Ocean\u2018s Eleven. His character in this film was called \u201cLamericano\u201d which means \u201cAmerican guy\u201d. As far as I know, nobody knows what happened to him afterwards since he disappeared off screen without giving us much information about himself.\nSo now that we have decided how to choose our favorite movie based on their nominees, lets see how they fared against each other!", "answer": null, "target": "(C)"}], "accuracy": 0.0}
