{"outputs": [{"input": "Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.\n\nQ: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.\nSentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.\nOptions:\n(A) The chief took the day off\n(B) The counselor took the day off\n(C) Ambiguous\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHere we need to determine who the pronoun \"they\" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for \"they\", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb \"told\" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form \"X told Y that (X or Y) did something.\"\nLet's consider Y first: \"X told Y that Y did something.\" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.\nNow, consider X: \"X told Y that X did something.\" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.\nBecause in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).\n\nQ: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.\nSentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.\nOptions:\n(A) The secretary didn't reply yet\n(B) The manager didn't reply yet\n(C) Ambiguous\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHere we need to determine who the pronoun \"he\" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for \"he\", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs \"sent\" and \"reply\" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form \"X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.\"\nLet's consider Y first: \"X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet.\" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.\nNow, consider X: \"X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet.\" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.\nBecause in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).\n\nQ: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.\nSentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office\nOptions:\n(A) It will be Bailey's office\n(B) It will be the director's office\n(C) Ambiguous\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHere we need to determine who the pronoun \"his\" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for \"his\", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase \"plan to meet\" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form \"X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.\"\nLet's consider Y first: \"X will plan to meet Y at Y's office.\" This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.\nNow, consider X: \"X will plan to meet Y at X's office.\" This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.\nBecause both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).\n\nQ: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.\nSentence: The patient was referred to the specialist because he had a rare skin condition.\nOptions:\n(A) The patient had a skin condition\n(B) The specialist had a skin condition\n(C) Ambiguous\nA: Let's think step by step.", "prediction": "\nThis question requires an understanding of what kind of situation the person being treated has been put into. If you were asked if someone else had a skin condition like this, how could you respond? You may say yes, no, maybe, I don't know...or perhaps even ask why they're having such a problem. But when you hear the word \"specialist,\" do you immediately picture a doctor treating people with skin conditions? Or do you imagine a different type of medical professional? Maybe there isn't any difference between these types of doctors; however, your response depends on whether you've ever heard of dermatologists or plastic surgeons. What kinds of things can happen to patients' bodies after surgery? How common are skin problems among young children? Do you really understand what the term \"rare\" means? Are all skin diseases considered rare? Is it okay to refer to a particular disease as \"rare\"? Does anyone actually call their child \"rare?\" These questions require further thought than simply answering \"yes\".\nSo let's look again at our example from above. We see that the subject of the sentence is the patient. He/she needs treatment for a very serious illness. Now suppose that instead of saying \"the patient needed treatment for a very serious illness,\" you said \"The patient received treatment for a severe skin infection.\" Would that change anything? Of course not! That still describes exactly what happened. However, since the patient wasn't specifically named, it seems reasonable to assume that the other person receiving care was the doctor. And since the doctor was called out to treat the patient, wouldn't that mean that she/he must have special training in dealing with skin infections? Again, though, just because the doctor is called out to deal with a specific ailment doesn't necessarily imply that her/him knows everything about every single health issue under the sun. Therefore, while the statement itself sounds correct, its use implies that the doctor is knowledgeable enough to handle whatever comes along.
