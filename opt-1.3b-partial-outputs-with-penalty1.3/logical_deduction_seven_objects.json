Eli finished below Amy.\nOptions:\n(A) Amy finished last\n(B) Eli finished last\n(C) Eve finished last\nA: Let's think step by step.\n(1) Eve finished above Amy: \"(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)\".\n(2) Eli finished below Amy: \"(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)\".\n(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: \"(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)\".\nAccording to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.\nEli finished last. So the answer is (B).\n\nQ: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.
